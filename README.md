🛒 Test Automation for Demoblaze Cart Page Using Cypress and POM

🎯 Objective :--
Develop a strong test automation framework for the Demoblaze Cart Page using Cypress and the Page Object Model (POM). This framework will verify key cart functionalities, user interactions, and responsiveness to ensure a smooth shopping experience.

🏗️ What You Will Do:--

🚀 Set Up Cypress
Install and configure Cypress for the project.
Organize folder structures for page objects, test cases, and test data.

📄 Implement POM:--
Create Page Object Classes for:

Cart Page 🛍️:--
Product Listing Page 🏷️

Checkout Page 💳:--
Define reusable methods to interact with elements like product lists, cart operations, and buttons.
Apply assertions to verify workflows, such as:
Adding/removing items from the cart.
Validating cart totals.

📝 Write Test Cases:--
Using POM methods, write modular and reusable test cases for:
Adding and removing products in the cart.
Validating cart totals and product details.
Navigating to the checkout process.

✅ Run and Validate Tests:--
Execute test cases using Cypress CLI or GUI.
Ensure all functionalities work as expected.

🔑 Key Features to Test:--

🛍️ Cart Functionality:--
Validate product display in the cart (name, price, quantity).
Test removal of items and verify that the total price updates correctly.

➕ Adding Products to Cart:--
Verify products can be added from the Product Listing Page.
Apply filters (if applicable) to check for correct product details.

🛒 Checkout Navigation:--
Test navigation from cart to checkout page.
Ensure cart details persist correctly on the checkout page.
Perform assertions after the checkout process.

💰 Cart Total Calculations:--
Verify the total price updates dynamically when items are added or removed.
Check behavior for empty carts, ensuring correct messages are displayed.

📱 Responsiveness and Layout:--
Test the cart page on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
Ensure proper layout and functionality of all elements.

🔗 Footer Links:--
Validate footer links for correct redirection (e.g., Home, Contact).

🛠 Tools and Languages Used;--
Testing Framework: Cypress 🧪
Programming Language: JavaScript (ES6) 📜
Test Runner: Cypress Test Runner 🚀
Page Object Model (POM): Organized test structure 📂
CI/CD Integration: GitHub Actions

📄 Documentation Tasks:--
Test Plan 📜
Test Scenarios and Test Cases 🗂️
Bug Report 🐞
Summary Report 📊
Mind Map 🧠

🎯 Expected Outcome :--
✅ A reusable and modular Cypress automation framework using POM.
✅ Complete test coverage for cart functions, product management, and checkout.
✅ Clear documentation, including test plans, bug reports, and summary reports.
✅ Enhanced cart page reliability for a seamless shopping experience.
